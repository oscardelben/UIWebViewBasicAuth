Basic Auth Support for NSMutableURLRequest.

To use, download the project directory and drag it into your own project.

On your class:

    #import "NSMutableURLRequest+BasicAuth.h"

    NSMutableURLRequest *req = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
    
    [req addBasicAuth:username andPassword:password]; // Username and password are NSString variables
    
    [self.webView loadRequest:req];

That's it. Enjoy
